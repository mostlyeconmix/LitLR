LitLR (version 0.0.1, 12/18/2013)
=================================

LitLR is a minimal reproducible research framework for LaTeX and R
that uses a subset of [Knitr's](http://yihui.name/knitr/)
functionality.

The main (only) advantage of LitLR is that it extracts R code from
ordinary LaTeX files that can be compiled directly to dvis or pdfs
whether or not the R code has run.

This package has just been started and should not be considered
production-ready. Use it for fun, and use it at your own risk!

Use
---

First, run

    latex example.tex

and notice that the document ends, "which is ?."  Then run

    Rscript litlr.R example.tex
    Rscript example.R
    latex example.tex

and observe that the question mark has been replaced with a number.
The main benefit of this package is that the first instance of

    latex example.tex

runs without error, which can be useful when working collaboratively
or if the R code takes a long time to execute.

Dependencies
------------
* `LaTeX` and the `listings` package
* `R` and the `knitr` package
