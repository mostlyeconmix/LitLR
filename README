Litlr (version 0.0.0, 12/18/2013)
=================================

Litlr is a minimal literate programming framework for LaTeX and R that
uses a subset of [Knitr's](http://yihui.name/knitr/) functionality.

The main (only) advantage of Litlr is that it extracts R code from
ordinary LaTeX files that can be compiled directly to dvis or pdfs
whether or not the R code has run.

This package has just been started and should not be considered
production-ready. Use it for fun, and use it at your own risk!
